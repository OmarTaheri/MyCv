    description:
      "My mom encouraged me to take a programming course in my small city (one of the best things she ever did for me). It was the first time I saw programming language syntax, but after finishing the course, I was ready to build an app for a school in exchange for free tuition. It was a great experience to see my app used in the school, but I wanted to learn more.",

      "With a newfound focus on earning money online, I started freelancing on Khamsat. As I wasn't even 15 years old, I used this account: https://khamsat.com/user/octopusdesigns/reviews. I managed to earn 80$ in 2 weeks, even transferring 20$ to my mom's bank account just to confirm it was real (I know, I was young!). I stopped because 80$ wasn't enough, so I saved the remaining 60$ in a PayPal account while improving my programming skills.",

I capitalized on this by creating more landing pages and earned 20K in a year. However, I stopped because I wasn't passionate about this work and wanted to delve deeper into programming.",
