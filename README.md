# My CV 💼

**Design Created By Me:** Simple Personal CV Resume website on [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots/24119834-Simple-Personal-CV-Resume-website)

This is a verry simple web application created with Next.js 14.2 that allows you to create and manage your professional CV or resume. ✨ The app is designed to be user-friendly and easy to navigate, making it convenient for you to showcase your skills, experience, and achievements to potential employers. 🏆

It took me 6-8 hours to design the UX/UI, write the code, and deploy the application on Vercel.

**Deployment:** [CV App](https://omartaheri.me)
